First  i copied lib and assets
Then i changed the medicalapp path for importing to breathe
Then i commented out the testimage.dart file because i didnt import firebase yet
i also added the dependency of app localization
lets try to build!!!

Added the icon dependency 
Everything seems stable, build is fine, and icon changed.


Added CoursesPage, JobPage, and NewsPage to the main pageg as filler for the icons so when you tap it it works.

In the learning material page i made a separate call for material

TODO
Add chewie and make it play from the bucket
Test to see if it works

added chiewi and video_player dependencies and it builds fine

made globals.dart and imported to main

Followed the chewie tutorial and added a video not sure if it works yet.
it worked :DDDD

now build apk release and put it in the drive just incase 

created back up in backup2 with the latest being this^
changed wrapper gradle properties so that tha tgardle link is a link and works will try to compile.

added firebase storage dependency in android app level gradle, the 19.0.1 version crashed the app so i degraded to 16 i think.
Now trying to make the storage ref work..

added plugin dependencies in gradle files and had to change the version of the google plugin to 4.0.2 instead of 4.3.2 for it to work. 
Also changed the name of the app in googleplay services to breathe instead of medicalapp.

builds fine but now the videos get bugged if i full screen.

added something about lint in adnroid build gradle under android
